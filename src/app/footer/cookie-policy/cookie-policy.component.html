                            <p>When you visit our website, open our e-mails, or view our services online, MOLADOR or an authorized third party may send you a cookie. Cookies are small text files located in your browser directory that may be placed on your
                                device. When the website is accessed, a cookie that is placed on a device will send information to the party that has placed the cookie. Cookies are extremely common and used on a number of websites. Each cookie will typically
                                contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value (usually a unique number). For a more thorough explanation of what cookies are and how they operate, please visit

                            <p>Cookies allow a website owner to do useful things; for example, a cookie would permit a website owner to find out whether a computer (and probably its user) has visited the site previously. In general, the purpose of cookies
                                is to improve the performance of the website and the user’s experience in using that website. Cookies help to make a website work more efficient, enable extra functionality, and provide website owners with additional information
                                about your visit to a website. Cookies also allow a website owner to track overall site usage and determine areas that users prefer. Cookies help make the user’s visit to a website easier by recognizing the user upon return
                                and providing a customized experience.</p>

                            <p>Our website may place first party cookies and allow third parties to place cookies on your device. The difference between a first party cookie and a third party cookie relates to the control of the party who serves the cookie.
                                First party cookies are cookies that are specific to the website that created them. Their use enables us to operate an efficient service and to track the patterns of behavior of visitors to the website. Third party cookies,
                                on the other hand, are placed on your device by a third party (i.e., not by MOLADOR). While we may allow third parties access to the website to place these cookies on users’ devices, we do not retain control over the information
                                supplied by the cookies, nor do we retain access to that data. This information is controlled wholly by that third party in accordance with their respective privacy policy.</p>

                            <p>Our websites may place session and persistent cookies on your device. Whereas the difference between a first party and third party cookie relates to the party controlling the initial placement of the cookie on your device,
                                the difference between a session and a persistent cookie relates to the length of time the cookie lasts. Session cookies are cookies that typically last for as long as you are using your browser or as the browser session.
                                When you end your browser session, the cookie expires. Persistent cookies, as the name implies, are persistent and will last after you close your browser. This allows for quicker and often more convenient access to our
                                website.

                            <p>There are other technologies that perform a similar function to cookies. These include web beacons and clear gifs. These are often used in conjunction with cookies to help a website owner understand its users better. When we

                                e-mail has been opened, MOLADOR includes a "web beacon" in the majority of HTML e-mail messages we send. A web beacon (actually a small .gif image) is activated when an HTML e-mail is opened via a request for the image
                                on our servers. This capability helps MOLADOR send e-mail in a format that users can read and enables MOLADOR to track the aggregate number of e-mails opened. The web beacon does not collect any personal data. Users that
                                do not want to receive e-mail messages with web beacons can choose to receive their e-mails in text (non-HTML) format.</p>
